# Retree

## Installation

```sh
yarn global add retree-cli
```

or

```sh
npm install --global retree-cli
```

## Usage

```sh
retree
```

This will open a tree view of the current directory in YAML format in your favorite `$EDITOR`.

Any change you do there will be applied when you close the file; you can:

- create files
- create directories
- rename files
- rename directories
- copy files
- copy directories
- delete files
- delete directories
- any combination of the above

Multi-cursors in text editors are so natural to use that you can quickly edit your directory structure using retree, the same way you would edit a text file.

Example use cases:

- rename all .js files to .ts
- add a .spec.ts file alongside every .ts file
- visualize all files in a project in one glance (no edit)
